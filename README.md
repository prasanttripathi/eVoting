Note :

* Unfortunately i do not have db scripts for this.Based on my thoughts i used to develop a database for this.You can use code first approach of entity framework
because classed are already present and it will be very simple to develop database.I will be attaching db.bak file to this project soon.

*this is not a production level code. we have not used any production design pattern here.code is as simple as i could write to help everyone to understand the MVC concepts 
and other technologies like entity framework and Linq.
In real time scenario will be different.We can use onion architecture .Please read articles for MVC architecture for more details.
