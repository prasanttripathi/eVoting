Note :

* Unfortunately i do not have db scripts for this.Based on my thoughts i used to develop a database for this.Model classes are present in code .Either You can use code first approach of entity framework to generate DB and add your own data or you can make use of db backup file that i have uploaded database backup to db backup branch

*this is not a production level code. we have not used any real time production design pattern here.code is as simple as i could write to help everyone to understand the MVC concepts and other technologies like entity framework and Linq.
In real time ,scenario will be different and we have to be focused on Architecture . We can use onion architecture or there are other type of architecture are available .Please read articles for MVC architecture for more details.
